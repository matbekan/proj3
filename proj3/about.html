			<em> Istinita priča započinje na provansalskoj tržnici. Opremljen optimizmom, kamiončićem i znanjem o biljkama, 23-godišnji Olivier Baussan upustio se, za početak, u preradu ulja ružmarina. Ovo ulje je prodavao lokalno i to je bio početak uspješne priče. Proširivši proizvodnju na sapune i kreme inspirirane zemljom u kojoj je odrastao, želja mu je bila dovesti prirodne proizvode u domove diljem svijeta.r </em>

				<h1 class="naslov"> PUTOVANJE KOJE JE ZAPOČELO U PROVANSI</h1>
				<p>
				In 1976, 23-year-old Olivier Baussan used steam distillation to produce essential oil from wild rosemary[3] and lavender which he sold at open-air markets in his native Provence. L'Occitane was named for the women of Occitania. This area existed during the Middle Ages, spanning southern France, north-eastern Spain and northern Italy. Occitan was the native language and is still spoken as a second language in some areas of this region.

In 1976, using an old soap factory that was donated to him, Olivier Baussan revives the traditional art of Marseille soap-making in Manosque, another Provençal village. He manufactured vegetable-based soaps. The first L'Occitane factory and boutique opened in 1981 in Volx, a village in Provence.[4] In the 1990s, Baussan sold a majority stake in the business to venture capitalists to finance expansion. As their approaches were incompatible, Baussan found himself excluded from daily management and strategic decision-making.[5]
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1994, Austrian businessman Reinold Geiger bought a 33% stake in the group.[4] Through a series of capital increases, Geiger became majority shareholder in 1996.[4] Geiger, as the new chairman, asked Baussan to return as creative director and lead product development. The company's new focus on marketing strategy paved the way for international expansion.[5] In the late 1990s the company changed its name to 'L'Occitane en Provence', to strengthen the connection with the company's roots and because the term 'Provence' had more meaning to an international audience.[6] On 20 April 2001, Clarins became a financial investor in the company through subscription to approximately 5.18% of the company's shares and €11,433,750 convertible debenture loan. On 22 February 2005, Clarins further invested €16,525,580 in convertible debentures. When the debentures were converted, Clarins held 23.33% of the shares. The management executed a leveraged buyout in May 2007 following which Reinold Geiger's stake rose from 31.9% to 48.7%, and Clarins' stake was diluted to 10.0%.[4]

					<h3> Pomičemo granice </h3>
				<p>
				L'Occitane en Provence and commonly known as L'Occitane, is an international retailer of body, face, fragrances and home products based in Manosque, France. The company was founded in 1976 by Olivier Baussan with the purpose to create a company that celebrates and preserves the traditions of his native Provence. The company name means "the Occitan woman [in Provence]".[2]

In 2010, the company became listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
				</p>
				
				
				<p>
			n March 2010, the listing committee of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange approved its plan for a $400–$600 million initial public offering of L'Occitane International S.A., underwritten by CLSA, HSBC and UBS which the company had originally planned in 2008, but postponed because of the 2008 financial crisis.[11] The company stated that two-thirds of the proceeds would be used to finance store openings.[9] China Investment Corporation invested US$50 million in the company's IPO as the cornerstone investor (for approximately 1.9% of the shares).[12] Following the listing of shares in L'Occitane International SA, L'Occitane Groupe SA detains 75% of the shareholding of the company; shares owned by Geiger, Clarins and other shareholders are indirect.[4]

					<h3> Beauty products</h3>
				<p>
				All of L'Occitane's products are developed and produced from its base in Manosque, where 1,000 employees work.[7] The company sources the majority of its production from Provence and one of their main product l'Immortelle plants (Helichrysum italicum) from Corsica from producers who rely on traditional production methods.

L'Occitane contributes to preserve traditional cultivation methods by:
				<ol>
					<li>Supporting the program to cultivate almond trees in the Alps of Haute-Provence. </li></br>
					<li>Preserving certain rare species through the planting of their own field of Immortelle flowers in Corsica. </li> <br>
					<li>Developing partnerships with organisations that support the development of scented and aromatic plants, such as the Office National Interprofessionel des Plantes à Parfum </li> </br>
					<li>Encouraging traditional cultivation, particularly that of lavender. </li>
				</ol>
